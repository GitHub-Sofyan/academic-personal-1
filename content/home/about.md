# Biography

I am an athlete developer with a belief that high performance is achieved through an integrated multi-disciplinary approach, based on actual data and not just pure empirical "say-so". I passionately believes in a long-term and data-driven approach to development for both athlete and coach.

As an Strength and Conditioning (S&C) Coach, I have had the honor of coaching athletes throughout the full training spectrum from developmental youths to elite adults.

As a Sports Science practitioner, I have contributed through several sports science disciplines and am a firm believer of an integrated/interdisciplinary approach.

As a Data Analyst, I am looking to develop further into machine learning and its integration in sports performance

Experienced in the area of Biomechanics, Performance Analysis, Data Analytics and Strength and Conditioning.

An Eternal Student:
_"Always Learning, Always Growing"_

I am honored to be recognised as a [SkillsFuture Fellow](http://www.skillsfuture.sg/fellowships/b18) for 2018.
SkillsFuture Fellow 2018

* Presented by the President of the Republic of Singapore, the SkillsFuture Fellowships honour individuals as masters of skills and mentors of future talent.
