# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "- Created a youth-specific basic movement screening to assess, the movement and physical competency of the new students (aged 11 to 12) to the Singapore Sports School. 
- The physical screening ensured that we were able to spot any deficiencies in basic movement patterns due to early specialisation in sports and/or lack of exposure to other basic movements.
- This helped to ensure a more even and holistic physical development and time for the students at the school."
