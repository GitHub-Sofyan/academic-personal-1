# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The Athletic Training Competency (ATC), is the culmination, of more than 4 years of practical coaching experience and reinforced by numerous studies and observation that looked at the development of Singaporean youths at the Singapore Sports School. The results is a 4-5 years program long term physical development that is based on the youth's biological maturity (pre-pubescent, pubescent and post-pubescent) and guided by their actual physical capabilities. The BART is a guide on what to teach/coach and focus on for each individual athletes and can be used by any trained PE teacher or Strength and Conditioning Coach. It does not require any invasive determination of the youths's biological maturation and instead depends on a fairly consistent tracking of the youths physical development (eg. height etc.). One of the best project that I had the honor of leading and working on."
