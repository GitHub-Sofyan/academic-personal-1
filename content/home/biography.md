Summary
* Ground Up - From Sports Massuer to Sports Scientist and PhD Candidate
* Broad based and interdisciplinary
* Deepening specialisation

1) Ground Up
I am most proud of the fact that I started my journey in this industry from the ground up and through continuous upgrading and learning, rose through the ranks. I started as a Sports Masseur after compleing my Basic Sports Massage ourse. During my times as a Sports Masseur, I took additional course to upgrade myself such as the Sports Trainer cours, which allowed me to take additional roles and responsibilitities such as Sports Trainer to sports teams in Singapore. During my 3 years as a Sports Trainer, I completed my undergrdaute degree in Science (Sports Science).

Upon completion, I took on the role of Strength and Conditioning Coach at the Singapore Sports School for more than 6 years, in which I completed 2 post-graduate degrees as a full-time student while working full-time at the Singapore Sports School. I am especially proud of my Masters by Research, in which I was able to conduct a research project on the development of stretch shortening cycle in youths across different biological maturation. During this time, I also expanded my knowledge and skills in the area of notational and performance analysis. These provided me a complimentary skills and allowed me to see sports science and training from a more holistic point of view.
