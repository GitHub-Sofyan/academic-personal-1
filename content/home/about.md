# Biography

As an athlete developer, I believe in achieving high athletic performance through an integrated multi-disciplinary approach for both athletes and coaches. To achieve this outcome, I strongly believe in investing in a long-term data-driven approach. To date, I have been fortunate to be able to marry my love for Coaching and Data Analytics, to boost sports performance.

As a Strength and Conditioning (S&C) Coach for more than twelve years, I have coached athletes through the full spectrum from developmental youths to elite adults athletes.

As a Sports Science practitioner, I have worked in several sports science disciplines, and have served as a sports science coordinator for high performance athletes at the Olympic level.

As a Data Analyst, I am working towards combining machine learning and its integration with sports performance.

My experience is in the area of Biomechanics, Performance Analysis, Data Analytics and Strength and Conditioning.

In 2018, I was conferred the [SkillsFuture Fellow](http://www.skillsfuture.sg/fellowships/b18) title by the [President of the Republic of Singapore](https://www.istana.gov.sg/) in recognition of my skills and my commitment to mentor aspiring coaches.

An Eternal Student, _"Always Learning, Always Growing"_
