abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 European College of Sport Science. This study examined the associations between pre-game wellness and changes in match running performance normalised to either (i) playing time, (ii) post-match RPE or (iii) both playing time and post-match RPE, over the course of a field hockey tournament. Twelve male hockey players were equipped with global positioning system (GPS) units while competing in an international tournament (six matches over 9 days). The following GPS-derived variables, total distance (TD), low-intensity activity (LIA; {\textless} 15 km/h), high-intensity running (HIR; {\textgreater} 15 km/h), high-intensity accelerations (HIACC; {\textgreater} 2 m/s 2 ) and decelerations (HIDEC; {\textgreater} −2 m/s 2 ) were acquired and normalised to either (i) playing time, (ii) post-match RPE or (iii) both playing time and post-match RPE. Each morning, players completed ratings on a 0–10 scale for four variables: fatigue, muscle soreness, mood state and sleep quality, with cumulative scores determined as wellness. Associations between match performances and wellness were analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Combined time and RPE normalisation demonstrated the largest associations with $\Delta$wellness compared with time or RPE alone for most variables; TD (r = −0.95; −1.00 to −0.82, p =.004), HIR (r = −0.95; −1.00 to −0.83, p =.003), LIA (r = −0.94; −1.00 to −0.81, p =.026), HIACC (r = −0.87; −1.00 to −0.66, p =.004) and HIDEC (r = −0.90; −0.99 to −0.74, p =.008). These findings support the use of wellness measures as a pre-match tool to assist with managing internal load over the course of a fie ld hockey tournament. Highlights Fixtures during international field hockey tournaments are typically congested and impose high physiological demands on an athlete. To minimise decrements in running performance over the course of a tournament, measures to identify players who have sustained high internal loads are logically warranted. The present study examined the association between changes in simple customised psychometric wellness measures, on changes in match running performance normalised to (i) playing time, (ii) post-match RPE and (iii) playing time and post-match RPE, over the course of a field hockey tournament. Changes in match running performance were better associated to changes in wellness (r = −0.87 to −0.95), when running performances were normalised to both time and RPE compared with time or RPE alone. The present findings support the use of wellness measures as a pre-match tool to assist with managing internal load over the course of a field hockey tournament. Improved associations between wellness scores and match running performances were evident, when running variables were normalised to both playing time and post-match RPE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} JPES. The F{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}ration Internationale de Natation implemented rule changes in 2013 to promote more dynamic movement, creativity, explosive speeds and reduce static situations in water polo. This study aimed to determine if the intents of the rule changes were met. The characteristics of 16 international matches played by the same team under both the old (n = 8) and new (n = 8) rules were compared. Under the new rules, there was a decrease in the average total number of shots from the offensive 2-m area (72{\%}), impediments (70{\%}) in most field of play except the center, and ordinary fouls in the offensive 5 m and beyond area (57{\%}), thereby suggesting more dynamic play. Conversely, there was an increase in average total static time (25{\%}) arising from an increase in the average total number of exclusion fouls (110{\%}) albeit an increase in the number of passes prior to the offence (86{\%}). The intents of the rule changes were partially achieved.},

abstract = {Objective: This cross-sectional study aims to compare the differences between the countermovement jump (CMJ) and concentric only squat jump (SJ) (no arm swing) and examine the differences and slow SSC ability of youths at different stages of maturation (pre-pubescent, pubescent and post pubescent). Methods: 101 male and 109 female Singaporean youths were recruited and divided into different maturational status. The youths performed up to six trials of CMJ and SJ each on a force plate to determine the SSC augmentation found in a CMJ. Various variables and ratios were used to compare the differences between the CMJ and SJ. Comparisons were made across both genders and the three different maturations phases. Further analysis was conducted to determine if the dependent variables differed according to the gender and/or maturity status of the youths. Results: Significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) were found between males and females across all of the SJ and CMJ variables with the exception of relative mean concentric power (MCP) for the CMJ and eccentric utilisation ratio (EURs) (jump height and peak force). Gender differences were observed for other variables and these differences increased with maturity. Variables in SJ performance across the maturational groups were different as compared to CMJ performance, where no significant maturational differences were observed. Conclusion: It would seem that concentric force/power capabilities are more likely to be influenced by maturation than eccentric force and power. Furthermore it appears that the eccentric capability and thus SSC augmentation is optimal around pubescence and with maturity this ability diminishes to some extent.},
