# Biography
I'll connect the dots for you..... | Inquistive Individual

I excel in being the bridge (and not just the middleman) between the technical/specialist side and the management/end-user. I relish in both; starting projects and problem-solving requiring technical knowledge/expertise especially together with other specialists and experts in the field and focusing on the execution and delivery. 

As with any curious individual, I am constantly exploring other areas that can be integrated such as programming, analytics and application of technology in specialised/technical domain. Especially areas, that are not traditionally synonymous with what I have primarily focused on such as ethics, epistemology and religion. 

I am honoured to be recognised as a [SkillsFuture Fellow](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/fellowships/b18).
- Presented by the [President of the Republic of Singapore](https://www.istana.gov.sg/), the SkillsFuture Fellowships honour individuals as masters of skills and mentors of future talent.
